          <h3>Where does the money come from?</h3>
          <p class="text">You may know you pay taxes, but don't how know those dollars get to schools, roads or the Mayor. The answer is <b>funds</b>. Cleveland has 8 funds, with each fund having restrictions on how the money can be spent and on what.</p>
          <p class="text">
          </br>Money for <u>Utilities</u> comes from the Major Enterprise Fund. The Major Enterprise Fund pays for the city's public utilities specifically covering:
            <ul>
              <li>Water</li>
              <li>Sewer</li>
              <li>Electricity (Cleveland Public Power)</li>
              <li>Airport</li>
            </ul>Unlike other funds that are paid for through tax dollars, the services in this fund are mostly paid for by user fees, such as when you pay your energy bill.
            </br></br>In times when user fees aren't enough to cover all expenses, some money is transferred from the General Fund.

          <h2>What reforms are being asked for? </h2>
            <b>Increased Renewable Energy Utilities:</b>
            <p>Reforms for energy generation are being asked can be found in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z3234sMp7S7MjaXvMgcZtcAaYs4x2oHE/view">Cleveland Climate Action Plan -2018 version</a> and the more recent <a href="https://theoec.org/publications/clevelandenviropolicyplatform/">2021 Cleveland Comprehensive Environemtal Policy Platform</a>.
            <br><br>These plans have stated goals of:
            <ul>
              <li>15% of electricity is by renewable sources 2022</li>
              <li>25% of electricity is by renewable sources by 2030</li>
              <li>100% of electricity is by renewable sources by 2050</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Are we still on track to get to 15% by 2022?</b>
            <br>According to Cleveland Public Power, here are the projects that have been invested in recently.
            <ul>
              <li>Quasar - Anaerobic digestion</li>
              <li>5 Hydro Plants</li>
              <li>A 4,200 Solar Panel Farm on E. 82nd & Kinsman</li>
              <li>3 Wind projects</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>2005- W/ Great Lakes Science Center</li>
                  <li>2012 - Blue Creek Wind Farm w/ American Municipal Power (AMP)</li>
                  <li>(In progress) - Icebreaker Wind w/ Lake Erie Energy development Corporation (LEEDCo)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            It is unclear how much has been spent on these projects thus far, but a rough calculation shows the has been generating 81.7 MW, which is ~27% of Clevelands Energy usage (300 MW). This mean Cleveland is on track for it's 25% goal, but does not have more in the pipeline to get us to 100%.
            <br><br><b>Utilities Shut-offs:</b>
            </br>The COVID-19 pandemic has placed many households at risk of losing access to basic utilities, compounding an already tenuous financial situation for lower income households in the region. The city said there were 89,470 Cleveland Water customers behind on their utility bills with an average of $481.02 owed. As many as 28,545 Cleveland Public Power customers are behind on their monthly bills with an average amount of $281.39 owed.
            </br><br>Let run some hypotheticals:
              <ul>
                <li>It would cost the city <b>$8M</b> to cover the utilities for <b>28,545 people</b> in 2020 who were unable to afford their energy utilities due to COVID-19 and other financial stress.</li>
                <li> It would cost the city another <b>$43 M</b> to cover the water utilities for the 89,470 people unable to afford their water bill. </li>
                <li>To cover utilies for all <b>114,000 households </b> in Cleveland(or 30% of the city population) who live below the poverty line, Cleveland could pay <b>$700</b> in energy and water utilities per household and it would cost <b>~$79.8 M a year</b>. For reference, thatâ€™s 20% of the current budget for Public Safety.
              </ul>
            Here are a few ideas for how, hypothetically, the city could pay for it:
              <ul>
                <li>Raise utility costs for households who make above $100,000 dollars</li>
                <li>Transfer money from other departments</li>
                <li>Rainy day fund for delinquent households</li>
              </ul>
            <b>Clean Water Infrastructure:</b>
            </br> Since utilities also include water, we also want to highlight the Cleveland Action Plans water goals. The city has cited a goal of having the Cuyahoga River be delisted as an area of concern by 2025. NEORSD stormwater management projects to increase capture and treatment rates and prevent discharges into Lake Erie. (Green infrastructure projects such as the Doan Brook restoration) This, along with several other projects from local climate groups means the city is on track for hitting this goal.
