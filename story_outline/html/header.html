            <h1>Understanding the </br>Cleveland City Budget</h1>
            <p>
              </br>Budgets are moral documents.
              <b>They reflect what - and who - a city deems worthy of investment.</b>
            </br></br>This is a civic acountablility project by a small group of citizens of Cleveland who want to use the budget to hold our politicians accountable.
              </br></br>There were 4 steps to acomplish our goal:
              <ol>
                <li>Dive into the Cleveland Budget to understand how the city spends money.</li>
                <li>Compare the budget to existing promises and visions put forth by civic groups in Cleveland.</li>
                <li>Put the results online to promote transparency to all Clevelanders.</li>
                <li>Work with activists and civic groups to use the results to promote concrete policy or budget changes.</li>
              </ol>
              </br>We spent the past few months going deep into four categories of city spending: Policing, the Judicial System, Energy & Water Infrastructure, and Road Infrastructure.
              </br></br>Along the way we learned that Education and Public Transit, although funded by the city, the details of those budgets are not included in the main Cleveland City Budget document. It is for that reason those categories are not included.
