            <h1>Understanding the </br>Cleveland City Budget</h1>
            <p>
              </br>Budgets are moral documents.
              <b>They reflect what - and who - a city deems worthy of investment.</b>
            </br></br>This is a civic accountability project by a small group of citizens of Cleveland who want to use the budget to hold our politicians accountable to their past promises.
          </br></br>There were 4 steps to accomplish our goal:
              <ol>
                <li>Dive into the Cleveland Budget to understand how the city spends money.</li>
                <li>Compare the budget to existing promises and visions put forth by civic groups in Cleveland.</li>
                <li>Post the results online to promote transparency to all Clevelanders.</li>
                <li>Work with activists and civic groups to use the results to promote concrete policy or budget changes.</li>
              </ol>
            </br>We spent the past few months diving deep into four categories of city spending: Policing, the Judicial System, Utilities, and Infrastructure.
              </br></br>Our initial investigation is contained to the City of Clevelandâ€™s annual budget book. While topics such as education and public transit are core components of how our city functions, they are not included on this site because their funding mechanisms are extremely complex. For example, both the Cleveland Metropolitan School District and Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority have their own annual budget books with revenue exceeding $1 billion and $312 million, respectively.
