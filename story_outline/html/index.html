          <h3>Where does the money come from?</h3>
          <p class="text">You may know you pay taxes, but don't how know those dollars get to schools, roads or the Mayor. The answer is <b>funds</b>. Cleveland has 8 funds, with each fund having restrictions on how the money can be spent and on what.</p>
          <p class="text">
          </br>Funding for Judicials Services come from The General Fund. The General Fund covers expenses for what we typically think a city does - Mayor, city council, police and more.
          </br></br> More specifically, the General Fund covers expenses for 11 departments which cover the following areas:
          <ul>
            <li>Judicial</li>
            <li>Courts</li>
            <li>Public Safety</li>
            <li>Fire</li>
            <li>Emergency Responders</li>
            <li>Waste Collection</li>
            <li>Recreation</li>
            <li>Health Centers</li>
            <li>Housing</li>
            <li>City Council</li>
            <li>the Mayor’s office</li>
          </ul>
        </br>The General Fund gets its money from many sources, but most of it (66%) comes from income taxes.

          <h3>What has been the past history of police reform in Cleveland?</h3>
          <p class="text">
            The summer 2020, protests all around America were happening asking for “Defund the Police.” The topic became a national focus, but still has many open questions. What does it mean to defund the police?
            </br></br>Let’s start with a short history of Cleveland police reforms.
            </br></br><b>2004</b>
            <ul>
              <li>In 2004, after years of budget deficits, Cleveland city government was finally forced to make budget cuts to the police department. The 2004 budget cut $17.5 dollars.</li>
              <li> Note that a decrease in dollars did not mean a decrease in police officers. By 2005, the city budgeted for an increase of 38 full time employees which increased police employment to 2,008 full time employees while still reducing the annual budget by another $2.8 M. </li>
              <li>In 2006, the department would see a $5.5 M increase along with an increase of another 55 employees.</li>
            </ul>
            <a href="">Source</a>
            </br></br><b>2015</b>
            <ul>
              <li>In addition, in 2012 Timothy Russel and Malissa were shot by the police 137 times.</li>
              <li>In 2014, Tamir Rice, an unarmed 12-year-old with a toy gun, was fatally shot by the Cleveland police at close range in the Cudell Commons park, seconds after the police arrived. </li>
              <li>In 2015, the Department of Justice issued a consent decree because of constituent excessive use of force.</li>
              <li>The consent decree demands many changes, the full list of which can be found here, and had a number of impacts on the Public Safety budget. Specifically, new funding was allocated to support staffing for the Office of Professional Standards, Police Review Board, Community Police Commission, Police Inspector General, and Department of Justice. The support for these entities added approximately $7.7 M to the Public Safety budget each year, beginning in 2016.</li>
              <li>As a result, budgeted staffing levels fluctuated during ensuing years, reaching a low of 1,773 full time employees in 2016 despite a $13.2 M increase from the 2015 budget year. Adjusted for inflation, the 2016 budget year was equivalent to the 2010 funding year, despite the 2010 budget allowing for 90 more full time employees.</li>
            </ul>
            <a href="">Source</a>
            </br></br><b>2020</b>
            <ul>
              <li>The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other unarmed Black Americans such as locals like Desmond Franklin, ignited widespread protests against police brutality, militarized police forces, and the larger institution of policing in the United States. Black Lives Matter has been at the forefront of this movement, inspiring widespread demands for cities to “Defund the Police.” As the movement grows, the demands have grown more specific and are:</li>
              <li>What happened in Cleveland between Tamir Rice and Desmond Franklin? From 2004 to 2015,the Police budget gradually decreased. 2015 marked a 19.2% decrease from 2004 and 20.6% decrease from 2002. </li>
              <li>However, the five years after 2015 saw a 12.7% increase to the budget with staffing increasing to 1,881 full time employees.</li>
              <li>How have other safety budgets fared in this same period?</li>
              <li>Fire has experienced a 23.4% decrease in full time staff since 2002, equating to a loss of 237 full time employees. The budget, adjusted for inflation, has experienced a 17.9% decrease over the same period.</li>
              <li>EMS has experienced a 17.3% increase in full time staff since 2002, equating to a gain of 49 full time staff. The budget, adjusted for inflation, has experienced a 31.2% increase over the same period.</li>

              <li>15% reduction in total tax dollars spent on policing in Cuyahoga County. (Note - This reduction most closely resembles 2012 policing levels, which equate to a 11.2% decrease from 2020. A full 15% decrease would require an $8.2 M reduction from the 2012 levels of policing - an amount in line with what is currently spent on meeting consent decree requirements.)</li>
              <li>Public commitment from city officials in the 2021 election cycle to establish a pilot program to modify the dispatch system to direct non-police emergency services to non-violent 9-1-1 calls.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>25% Reduction in total tax dollars spent on policing in Cleveland. (This reduction equates to a Police budget of roughly $163.7 M per year - a budget that is still more than four times greater than 2020 funding levels for EMS.)</li>
              <li>Abolition of at least 3 commissioned police departments in Cuyahoga County</li>
              <li>Overhaul of dispatch methodologies to exclude police entirely from non-violent emergencies</li>
              <li>Pilot program established to respond to mental health, domestic violence, or substance abuse related calls</li>

            <ul>
              <li>A single, accountable force under democractic control by the public is responsible for policing in Cuyahoga County.</li>
              <li>50% reduction in total tax dollars spent on policing in Cleveland. (This reduction equates to a Police budget of roughly $109 M per year, bringing Police funding in line with what the Fire Department received in 2008 (adjusted for inflation).</li>

              <li>Non-gated healthcare for all Cleveland residents, including access to abortions and reproductive health care</li>
              <li>Free Public Transit for all GCRTA buses and trains.</li>
              <li>Unionized Green Jobs guarantee, regardless of citizenship status</li>
              <li>Establishment of a Tax Abatement for Public Housing Development for at least 25,000 people.</li>
