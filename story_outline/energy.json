The city has cited a goal of having the Cuyahoga River be delisted as an area of concern by 2025. NEORSD stormwater management projects to increase capture and treatment rates and prevent discharges into Lake Erie. (Green infrastructure projects such as the Doan Brook restoration) This, along with several other projects from local climate groups means the city is on track/not on track for hitting this goal.",
